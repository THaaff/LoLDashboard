# LoLeSports-Dashboard
Dashboard made with Plotly Dash using web scraped data from lol.fandom.com

LoLDashboard.py outputs a link to the dashboard. There are still some cosmetic upgrades to be made, and changes will be needed when the LPL fills in the gaps in their data.

There is no need to use new links to be scraped, the permalinks to the queries will update with new match results and data soon after new matches finish, some changes will likely need to be made if this is going to hold up for Worlds, but that might be a separate dashboard.
